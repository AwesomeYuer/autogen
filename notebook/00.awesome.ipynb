      "1. 下载并读取订单数据文件：\n",

      "# 读取CSV文件\n",
      "df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 计算每个商品的平均价格：\n",
      "我们可以使用`groupby`函数按商品分组，并计算每个商品的平均价格。\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# filename: calculate_average_price.py\n",
      "\n",
      "# 按商品分组并计算平均价格\n",
      "average_price = df.groupby(\"Product\")[\"Price\"].mean()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 找到价格最高的商品：\n",
      "我们可以使用`idxmax`函数找到平均价格最高的商品。\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# filename: find_most_expensive_product.py\n",
      "\n",
      "# 找到平均价格最高的商品\n",
      "most_expensive_product = average_price.idxmax()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 检查该商品是否适合打折促销：\n",
      "根据具体的打折促销策略，我们可以使用条件语句来判断该商品是否适合打折促销。\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# filename: check_discount_eligibility.py\n",
      "\n",
      "# 检查商品是否适合打折促销\n",
      "if average_price[most_expensive_product] > 100:\n",
      "    print(f\"商品 {most_expensive_product} 适合打折促销\")\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    print(f\"商品 {most_expensive_product} 不适合打折促销\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "请按顺序执行以上代码，并查看打印的结果，以获取昂贵的商品是否适合打折促销。\n",
