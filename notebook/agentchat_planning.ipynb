    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Coding and Planning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use multiple agents to work together and accomplish a task that requires finding info from the web and coding. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write and debug Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the LLM-based `AssistantAgent` with a different system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install pyautogen and docker:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen docker\n",
    "```"
