      "As a scientist, your role is to review the extracted information and categorize the papers into different domains based on their content. Here's how you can proceed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Review the extracted information: Open the markdown table file (\"papers_table.md\") generated by the engineer. Read through the titles, authors, and abstracts of the papers to get an understanding of their content.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Categorize the papers into different domains: Based on the content of each paper, assign it to a specific domain. For example, if a paper is about LLM applications in computer vision, you can categorize it under the \"Computer Vision\" domain. Create a list of domains and assign each paper to the appropriate domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Update the `papers` dictionary: Open the engineer's code and locate the section where the `papers` dictionary is populated. Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary for the domain of each paper. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   papers.append({\"Title\": title, \"Authors\": authors, \"Abstract\": abstract, \"Domain\": domain})\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Save the updated code: Save the modified code with the updated `papers` dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Run the code: Execute the code to generate a new markdown table file with the updated domain information.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Review and provide feedback: Review the new markdown table file to ensure that the papers are correctly categorized into different domains. If any adjustments or corrections are needed, provide feedback to the engineer.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Repeat if necessary: If there are more papers to categorize, repeat steps 1-6 until all papers are assigned to appropriate domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have completed the categorization of papers into different domains, you can provide the final markdown table file to the engineer for further processing or dissemination.\n",
